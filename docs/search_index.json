Tickers such as Gamestop (GME) and AMC (AMC) have been in the forefront of retail investor’s minds. This project explores how well these stocks actually perform; it is easy to do this by tracking individual stocks, but investors almost never put their entire portfolio into a single stock; instead, they diversify their holdings to reduce risk of volatility. Therefore, to test whether these “wallstreetsbets” investors truly have an alpha (i.e. an edge) on the overall market, we simulate their positions by creating a “meme index” that buys all these different stocks and aggregates them under a single mock ETF (exchange-traded fund). We will visualize this ETF in a number of ways, and additionally add interactivity by letting the user drag a sliding bar that will show how the ETF performs daily, as well as how the stocks/components within change using a daily frequency. 2.2 Data availability Identify one or more data sources (see II. D. above) that you propose to draw on for the project. For each, describe how the data are collected and by whom. Describe the format of the data, the frequency of updates, and any other relevant information. Carefully document your sources with links. Explain how you plan to import the data. There are plenty of datasets available for us to get started on our project. We first have GME, whose daily closing prices can be found from https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?p=GME. This dataset is a clean dataset since we are guaranteed to have no NaN and no outliers. The format of the data is Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume. We will be primarily focused on the past year’s worth of daily close prices from this dataset, of which it contains all data points necessary. The data is scraped from the daily opening price, the closing price, and the recorded high and low prices per trading day. All of this is collected by Yahoo Finance. Another dataset that we will use is AMC. The dataset can be found from https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/history?p=AMC. This dataset is similar in structure to GME with the same column headings, data cleanliness (i.e. no missing prices, dates, etc.). Again, we will use the daily closing price for our project, which this dataset contains. The reason why we utilize this dataset is because AMC has been the second most popular stock amongst “meme investors”. This data is also scraped daily by Yahoo News at the closing bell. The third dataset that we will use is BBBY, which can be found at the following link: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/history?p=BBBY. The format and cleanliness of the data is the same as the previous two, as well as the source and frequency of data scraped. The reason why we use BBBY is because it gained humongous popularity during August/September when it spiked by 400-500%. The fourth dataset that we will utilize is TLRY, which can be found at the following link: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TLRY/history?p=TLRY. This stock has the same column headings and formatting as the previous stocks, and also comes from the same source with a daily frequency. The reason why we utilize this dataset is because it was also another meme stock that gained notoriety shortly after GME and AMC. The fifth dataset that we include in this list is Palantir Technologies (PLTR). The ticker price from the past year can be found at the following link ://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PLTR/history?p=PLTR. Column headings, formatting, and data cleanliness is the same as the previous datasets. The reason why we utilize this dataset is because the stock gained huge popiularity throughout COVID-19 because of its business model took advantage of the lockdowns. Even after those restrictions were lifted, meme investors have continued to talk about the stock, hence its continued popularity today. Although these five datasets would be sufficient to making a good index, we plan on including additional meme stocks over the next day or two to diversify our portfolio and to align our ETF to mirror meme stock investors’ portfolios more accurately. Yahoo Finance provides an API that lets us download the datasets (All of these prices will take the last 251 trading days, or past year of trading), in which we will utilize Python to clean the datasets before piping them into RStudio for visualization. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing Value Analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources As explained in the proposal we will work with financial meme stocks. The stocks we chose are the following: GME (GameStop Corp), AMC (AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc), BBBY (Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc), TLRY (Tilray Inc) and PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc). They are all belong to either the NYSE or to the NASDAQ. We will use the following packages for getting the data : ## [1] &quot;quantmod&quot; &quot;tidyquant&quot; &quot;pylr&quot; &quot;dplyr&quot; &quot;redav&quot; ## [6] &quot;tidyverse&quot; &quot;remotes&quot; &quot;naniar&quot; &quot;rollRegres&quot; &quot;zoo&quot; ## [11] &quot;plotly&quot; &quot;tseries&quot; We then use the QuantMod package to obtain our data. We use a date range from January 1, 2022 to the most recent date (December 14, 2022) for our stocks to get our YTD (Year to Date) data. Let’s see what values does the quantmod packages returns. ## [1] &quot;GME&quot; ## [1] &quot;AMC&quot; ## [1] &quot;BBBY&quot; ## [1] &quot;TLRY.TO&quot; ## [1] &quot;PLTR&quot; ## [1] &quot;SPY&quot; ## GME.Open GME.High GME.Low GME.Close GME.Volume GME.Adjusted ## 2022-01-03 37.3075 39.8450 37.3025 38.2100 5654800 38.2100 ## 2022-01-04 38.0425 38.2475 35.7625 37.2275 7339600 37.2275 ## 2022-01-05 37.0975 37.2125 32.2875 32.3425 13585600 32.3425 ## 2022-01-06 33.2100 34.4250 30.2850 32.7575 24206000 32.7575 ## 2022-01-07 39.9425 40.0775 33.1250 35.1550 48549200 35.1550 ## 2022-01-10 33.7475 33.9225 30.0000 32.7875 22048000 32.7875 As shown above, quantmod provides us the values of “Open”, “High”, “Low”, “Close”, “Volume” and “Adjusted” and Date for every day for each stock.

This will be important, as beta tells us how an individual stock performs relative to the market, while alpha tells us the stock’s excess return. We use a rolling window of 30. We also get the simple moving average (SMA) of our newly created portfolio to detected long-term trends. Finally, we calculate RSI (we base our code off this website: https://bookdown.org/kochiuyu/technical-analysis-with-r-second-edition2/relative-strength-index-rsi.html) to compare the performance of our portfolio with the SP500 ## [1] &quot;Portfolio Moving Average (First 5 Values):&quot; ## [1] 85.40075 84.84875 84.40192 84.11992 83.71708 83.05742 ## [1] &quot;SPY Moving Average (First 5 Values):&quot; ## [1] 453.5700 452.5163 451.4847 450.4407 449.3170 448.0997 ## rowname (Intercept) spy_close_log Date a_value beta_value ## 234 234 1.0882913 0.4728091 2022-12-06 1.0882913 0.4728091 ## 235 235 0.9456553 0.4956148 2022-12-07 0.9456553 0.4956148 ## 236 236 0.9689239 0.4911233 2022-12-08 0.9689239 0.4911233 ## 237 237 0.5835717 0.5546699 2022-12-09 0.5835717 0.5546699 ## 238 238 0.9112997 0.4986215 2022-12-12 0.9112997 0.4986215 ## 239 239 1.4408603 0.4085211 2022-12-13 1.4408603 0.4085211 ## DATE portfolio_open portfolio_high portfolio_low portfolio_close ## 1 2022-01-03 107.0075 111.9040 104.9625 107.4900 ## 2 2022-01-04 107.3025 108.5075 100.8925 104.3475 ## 3 2022-01-05 103.3975 104.4905 92.9675 93.6025 ## 4 2022-01-06 96.7000 100.3450 88.8000 94.5175 ## 5 2022-01-07 103.6625 107.0375 94.4100 97.7350 ## 6 2022-01-10 94.6375 96.6225 87.7700 94.3775 ## [1] &quot;First 5 Values of Portfolio RSI: &quot; ## [1] 14.285714 14.285714 14.285714 7.142857 7.142857 14.285714 ## [1] &quot;First 5 Values of SPY RSI: &quot; ## [1] 28.57143 28.57143 28.57143 28.57143 35.71429 42.85714 We now have all the required information for starting our data visualization! 3.3 Missing Value Analysis Although we have covered that there is missing data, we can visualize it by using a missing pattern graph, which can be found below.Please note that for the purposes of finding missing data, we merge the datasets to see if their are overarching patterns in the missing data. Although the labels are messy, one thing is clear: every single column is a complete case, which means that we do not have missing data throughout all our columns in all of our different stocks. We can also have an alternate view by using a heatmap of missing views: Again, we see that out of all our observations, all of them are present, signifying that there are no missing values in our data. #Results The way that we set our portfolio is that we take one share of each stock that we have chosen and aggregate it into a single portfolio. Let us examine a brief overview of how our stock has performed in the past two years through the following candlestick chart: We can also obtain the candlestick chart of the SP500 (ticker: SPY) as a point of comparison of how our portfolio compares to the overall market: When looking at the two graphs, there are two big trends; notably, there is a big downtrend in price for both our portfolio and the market in general. It is easier to track this big downtrend when comparing the simple moving average (SMA, or the black line) of the two different stocks. The magnitude of these changes, however, is significant. While the S&amp;P500 dropped approximately 25%, our new index dropped a whopping 63%. This my show that long-term investment in meme stocks may not be the best financial strategy for this year. The other trend is that there were two spikes upward in price for both our portfolio and the S&amp;P500; these are in relation to Q1 and Q2 results from major companies, all of which were struggling to show good results due to supply chain shortage. In addition, portfolio managers shift a lot of money during this quarter, which could contribute to the increased volatility in both March and August. In this case, the S&amp;P500 spiked by about 10% and 12% respectively; however, our meme stocks outperformed, spiking up a hefty 90% and 65%, respectively. Therefore, short-term or swing traders might have more profitable trades if playing for volatility. Although candlesticks are a good overview for both portfolios, it is hard to see overall trends even with the simple moving average. Therefore, to see longer-term trends, we can use the relative strength index (RSI) which indicates the relative strength of the price of the stock. We plot the RSI of our new portfolio, as well as the SPY as a point of comparison. When looking at the distributions of RSI scores for both the S&amp;P500 and the S&amp;P500, we see that both are approximately normally distributed. This is a good sign for both our portfolio and the general market; if we see that there is significant skew to either side of the RSI daily score, this would mean a long term trend in being oversold (skew right) or being overbought (skew left). Therefore, by being normalized, long-term traders can know that both of these stock indices are relatively stable. It is important to note that the spread of values is more extreme for our meme stock index compared to the market index, which means that there are greater swings in buy/sell territories of RSI (that is, buy signal for RSI &lt; 30 and sell signal for RSI &gt; 70). Therefore, this might dissuade long-term traders from investing in a meme stock index, as more buy/sell signals means instability in stock price growth. Although the distributions are relatively similar, we can see if there were periods of time where either index outperformed the other. Therefore, we make a line chart of the RSI to see if there are periods in time where our portfolio outperforms the market. This graph is an important alternative look to the previous histogram, as it benefits short-term/swing traders more than long-term investors. There are several important trends to point out in this graph. We see that, while the spread of RSI buy/sell signals was more spread out for our meme stock index, the number of buy signals is a lot more frequent than the S&amp;P500 (most notably in May, where there was a strong buy signal for 4 straight weeks!). Therefore, swing traders might benefit more from the meme stock index because the frequency and length of these buy signals. On the other hand, S&amp;P500 signals to buy are very few and far between (i.e. in March, June, and December), which may not benefit swing traders looking to make it rich quick. On the other hand, the S&amp;P only reached a sell signal once (in April), it was relatively mild and barely triggered with a score near 70. The story for the meme stock, on the other hand, is that when losses occur, they are big. When reaching overbought territory, RSI scores hit 79 and 93 respectively, which is nearly unheard of for big indexes and ETFs. With the right strategies (such as buying put options or shorting stock), swing traders can also profit off of these sell signals deep in the red. Therefore, we can conclude from this graph that, while holding throughout the year may result in better profitability for long-term investors, the right enter and exit strategies throughout the year (and a lot of luck) would actually result in higher returns for swing traders. Finally, we can see how our portfolio’s alpha beta compares with the SPY. Because we utilize the SPY as our benchmark, we do not plot the SPY beta in this graph (i.e. it will always be one for beta, and zero for alpha). When looking at the Beta and Alpha graph, the average investor would be slightly nervous, and rightly so. The beta is always above 1, and hovers between a value of 0.7 and 6. This means that our index is 0.7-6 times more volatile than the general market, which means any money invested has greater potential to gain or lose throughout the year due to high volatility. Generally, the higher the beta (and the greater the range of beta), the greater the risk+reward is compared to the general market. Although this may be good news for high-risk traders, the trade off may not be worth it. Generally, an alpha above 0 means that the stock performed relatively well compared to what the volatility of the stock predicted (for more information, please read on the CAPM model, of which this analysis is based). 0 means that it performed to expectation, and negative means it performed poorly to expectations. Our meme index firmly falls in this final category, with an alpha value as low as -34, which is nearly unattainable even for individual stocks, which typically have the highest beta, and therefore alpha, ranges. Therefore, both long-term traders and swing traders should stay far away from the index that we have generated, as returns for alpha very rarely reaches positive territory.
